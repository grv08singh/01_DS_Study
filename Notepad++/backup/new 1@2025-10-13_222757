I want to build a windows application in python to scrape data and deploy this application on streamlit cloud which can be used by anyone.
Write a python application code for the app with specifications below:

What this application will do:

1) In the same directory, read a csv file namely "input.csv" with 5 columns: "District", "Taluk", "Hobli", "Village" and "HSSN" having multiple rows.
2) for each row, grab all the values into same name variables and do the following:
	2.1) Create a pandas DataFrame with name "df" with 4 features namely: "S.No.", "Survey", "Surnoc", "Hissa".
	2.2) open a headless browser on cloud and open the website: "https://landrecords.karnataka.gov.in/service2/RTC.aspx"
	2.3) grab the dropdown control with ID "ctl00_MainContent_ddlCDistrict" and insert the value of "District" in it and press Tab key.
	2.4) grab the dropdown control with ID "ctl00_MainContent_ddlCTaluk" and insert the value of "Taluk" in it and press Tab key.
	2.5) grab the dropdown control with ID "ctl00_MainContent_ddlCHobli" and insert the value of "Hobli" in it and press Tab key.
	2.6) grab the dropdown control with ID "ctl00_MainContent_ddlCVillage" and insert the value of "Village" in it and press Tab key.
	2.7) run loop from survey=1 to HSSN and for each loop:
		2.7.1) parse the current loop value to the dropdown field with control ID "ctl00_MainContent_txtCSurveyNo" and press Tab key.
		2.7.2) click the button with control ID "ctl00_MainContent_btnCGo".
		2.7.3) for surnoc=each value present in the dropdown field with control ID "ctl00_MainContent_ddlCSurnocNo":
			2.7.3.1) press tab key.
			2.7.3.2) grab all the values present in the dropdown field with control ID "ctl00_MainContent_ddlCHissaNo" and save them df['Hissa'].
			2.7.3.3) for each "Hissa" feature value, save the value of survey loop in df['Survey'] and save the value of surnoc loop in df['Surnoc'].
	2.8) finally fill the serial number in df['S.No.']
	2.9) make a "Village".csv file from "df" and provide its download link.


2) first Input Textbox field will appear with name "District". User will provide alphabetical value in it.
3) Second Input Textbox field will appear with name "Taluk". User will provide alphabetical value in it.
4) Third Input Textbox field will appear with name "Hobli". User will provide alphabetical value in it.
5) Fourth Input Textbox field will appear with name "Village". User will provide alphabetical value in it.
6) Fifth Input Textbox field will appear with name "HSSN". User will provide Numeric Integer value in it.
